## Project objectives

Our project objective is to recieve and convert a morse code signal and represent it on 7-segment display embedded to Nexys-A7-50T circuit board. <br>

By recieving a morse signal either through Arduino microcontroller or switch embedded on Nexys-A7-50T board we desire to count the lenght of impulse
and then assume the represented morse code character.

## Hardware  
#### Nexys-A7-50T

The Nexys A7 board is a complete, ready-to-use digital circuit development platform 
based on the latest Artix-7™ Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) from Xilinx®. 
With its large, high-capacity FPGA, generous external memories, and collection of 
USB, Ethernet, and other ports, the Nexys A7 can host designs ranging from introductory combinational circuits to powerful embedded processors. 
Several built-in peripherals, including an accelerometer, temperature sensor, MEMs digital microphone, a speaker amplifier
,and several I/O devices allow the Nexys A7 to be used for a wide range of designs without needing any other components.

#### Arduino Uno
Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P (datasheet). 
It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz ceramic resonator (CSTCE16M0V53-R0), 
a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button.
